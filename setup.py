======

xls2db is a python program that takes an excel spreadsheet following a certain
schema into an sqlite database that can be opened using python's sqlite3 module.
It can also be used as a module.

Why??
-----

Because fuck you, that's why.

But seriously: I was getting sick of doing data entry for this toy project of
mine using cursor.execute()'s, so I figured I'd try entering the data into an
excel spreadsheet, converting it into the db, and then manipulating it from
there. Crazy, I know.

Usage:
--------

As a script::

    xls2db infile.xls outfile.db

As a module::

    from xls2db import xls2db
    xls2db("infile.xls", "outfile.db")
